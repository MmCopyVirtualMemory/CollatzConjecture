# Collatz-Conjecture

I created this after watching a youtube video about this mathematical conjecture called the Collatz Conjecture.

There are two main rules that need to be followed for each counting number starting from one to infinity ->
1. If the current number is odd, you must multiply it by three and add one making it even
2. If the number is even, you must divide by two.

The principle of the conjecture is that there will eventually be a point where every single number reaches the 4 -> 2 -> 1 loop.

Through the use of this program, you can test the conjecture for yourself and if given an infinite amount of time (and storage), you will be able to prove the conjecture either true or false. 
I checked up to 20k myself with no problems ;). According to the source where I found the conjecture, other mathematicians have gone so far as to check to 2^68th.

I had a lot of fun making this and trying out a different coding style to what I am used to so if there are any problems similar to this, please let me know because I would be happy to write another solution similar to this one.
